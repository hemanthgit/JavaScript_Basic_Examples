Data types in JavaScript
    The following are the different data types in JavaScript 
    Numbers - 5, 5.234 
    Boolean - true / false 
    String - "MyString", 'MyString'
To create a variable in JavaScript use 'var' keyword. 
    Variable names are case sensitive.
With JavaScript we always use var keyword to create any type of variable. 
Based on the value assigned the type of the variable is inferred.
    var a = 10; 
    var b = "VarmaTech";
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means JavaScript data types are converted automatically as needed during script execution.
When a + operator is used with 2 numbers, JavaScripts adds those numbers.
When a + operator is used with 2 strings, JavaScript concatenates those 2 strings.
When a + operator is used with a string and a number, JavaScript converts the numeric value to a string and performs concatenation.
But if you use a - operator, numeric value is not converted to string.
