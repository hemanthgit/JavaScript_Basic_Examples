Inheritance:
-------------
Object oriented programming languages support inheritance. 
Since JavaScript is also an object oriented programming language, it supports inheritance. 
In OOP languages like C# and Java to implement inheritance, a class inherits from another class.
In JavaScript, we don't have the concept of classes, so inheritance in JavaScript is prototype-based
