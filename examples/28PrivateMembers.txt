Private members in JavaScript:
------------------------------
In any object oriented programming language, classes can have private and public members.
so objects in JavaScript can also have private and public fields and functions. 

what is a Privileged Function?
    1. Privileged methods are created using "this" keyword and Public methods are created using prototype property of the constructor function. 
    2. Privileged method can access private variables and methods. 
    3. Public methods can call Privileged methods but not Private methods. 4. Like Public methods, Privileged methods are also available outside the constructor function.

Public fields and functions are available both inside and outside of the Employee() constructor function. 
Private fields and functions are available only inside the Employee() constructor function. 
Attempting to access private fields and properties outside of the constructor function will result in undefined error.

Can we modify a private field outside of the constructor function?
no you can't.You cannot access or modify private fields outside of the object.

Summary:
--------
Private fields -- Declared using the var keyword inside the object, and can only be accessed by private functions and privileged methods.
Public fields -- Declared using this keyword and are available outside the object.
Private functions -- Declared inside the object. Can be called only by privileged methods.
Privileged methods -- Declared using this keyoword and are available both within and outside the object.
Public methods -- Defined by using the object's prototype property and are available both within and outside the object.
