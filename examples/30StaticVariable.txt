Static members in JavaScript:
-----------------------------

What is the difference between static member and instance member?
    An instance member belong to a specific instance.
 So if I create 3 instances (objects) there will be 3 copies of instance fields in memory.
 where as there will be only one copy of a static field no matter how many instances we create.

 JavaScript can also have static and instance fields and methods.

 Points to remember:
 -------------------
  1. Define a static member using the name of the constructor function. 
  2. To invoke a static member use the name of the constructor function. 
  3. To invoke an instance member use the instance of the constructor function.

Just like a static variable, static method is also defined using the name of the "constructor function".
