Cookies:
--------
Why are cookies needed?
    Web applications work on HTTP protocol which is a stateless protocol. 
    This means after the web server has processed the client request for a web page, the web server will not remember anything about the client that made the request. 

What are cookies?
     Cookies are small text files that a browser stores in the visitor's computer.
     A cookie is basically a string of name-value pairs separated by semi-colons.

How does a cookie look?
        color=red; expires=Fri, 31 Aug 2018 01:00:00 UTC;
    In the cookie string above we have 2 name-value pairs. 
    "expires" attribute specifies when the cookie is going to expire.
    By default cookies are deleted when the current browser session ends.
    If you want to store the cookie on the client computer even after the browser session has ended then specify either expires or max-age attributes. 

How to write a cookie?
     Use the document object's cookie property to write the cookie. 
     Ex: document.cookie = "color=red;expires=Fri, 5 Aug 2016 01:00:00 UTC;"

How to read a cookie?
     Use the document object's cookie property to read the cookie.
     Ex: var cookieString = document.cookie;

optional cookie attribute values that can be specified when creating a cookie:
-------------------------
Optional Cookie Attributes:
    1.expires 
    2.max-age 
    3.domain 
    4.path 
    5.secure
expires and max-age attributes : 
    If you want to create a persistent cookie, that is a cookie that is not deleted after the browser is closed either use "expires" or "max-age" attributes.
    Ex: 
        1. document.cookie = "color=red;expires=Fri, 5 Aug 2016 01:00:00 UTC";
        2. document.cookie = "color=red;max-age=" + (60 * 60 * 24 * 30) + ";"// Creates a cookie that expires in 30 days
    
    What is the difference between expires and max-age attributes?
        With expires attribute you set an expiry date. Very few modern browsers support this attribute. Internet Explorer is one of them. 
        With max-age attribute you specify the expiry time in seconds. Most modern browsers support this attribute except Internet Explorer.
Note : If you want to create a persistent cookie that works in IE and all the other browsers then specify both expires and max-age attributes.

    domain attribute : Specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid. 
    If you specify the doamin as varmatech.blog.com then that cookie will be valid only for that sub-domain. It will not be valid for varmatech.com. 
    Note : 
    If you want a cookie to be valid for all sub-domains of varmatech.com then specify domain=varmatech.com. 
    So this cookie will be valid for 
        varmatech.com 
        blog.varmatech.com 
        blog.varma.varmatech.com
    
    path attribute : 
        By default cookies are valid only for web pages in the directory of the current web page that stored them, as well as its descendants. 
            ex: If a cookie is set by http://localhost/Home/Page2.htm, it will be valid for http://localhost/Home/SubFolder/Page1... but not for http://localhost/Page3.htm.
        If you want to create a cookie that is valid across all your pages in your website, then set the path attribute to the root of your web directory, that is, "/".
        Ex: document.cookie = "color=red;max-age=" + (60 * 60 * 24 * 30) + ";path=/";

        secure attribute : 
            secure attribute specifies that the cookie is secure and is only used over HTTPS protocol which ensures that the cookie is always encrypted when transmitting from client to server.
