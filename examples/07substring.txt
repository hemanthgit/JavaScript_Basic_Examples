The following are the 3 methods in JavaScript that can be used to retrieve a substring from a given string. 
    substring()
    substr() 
    slice()

substring() :
  This method has 2 parameters 'start' and 'end'. 
  'start' parameter is mandatory and specifies the starting position of the extraction. 
  'end' parameter is optional and specifies the ending positionof the extraction.
 Note : 1.The character at the end position is not included in the substring.
        2.If the value of start parameter is greater than the value of the end parameter, this method will swap the two arguments. 
        This means start will be used as end and end will be used as start.

substr() method : 
    This method has 2 parameters 'start' and 'count'. 
    'count' parameter is optional and specifies the number of characters to extract.
 Note : If the count parameter is not specified, all the remaining characters are extracted.
        If count is 0 or negative, an empty string is returned.

What is the difference between substr and substring methods ? 
    The difference is in the second parameter. 
     The second parameter of substring() method specifies the index position where the extraction should stop.
     The second parameter of substr() method specifies the number of characters to return.    

indexOf() method:
    This method returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string. 
    If the specified value is not present then -1 is returned.
