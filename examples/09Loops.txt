    How does the while loop work ?
    1. While loop checks the condition first 
    2. If the condition is true, statements with in the loop are executed 
    3. This process is repeated as long as the condition evaluates to true.

    What is the use of break statement?
    If break statement is used in a switch statement, it causes the execution to break out of that switch statement. 
    In a similar fashion, if used in a loop, the loop ends. 

    What is the use of  continue statement ?
    continue statement tells the JavaScript interpreter to skip remaining code that is present after this statement and start the next iteration of the loop.
do..while:
    1. do while loop checks its condition at the end of the loop 
    2. This means the do...while... loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time. 
    3. In general, do...while... loops are used to present a menu to the user
