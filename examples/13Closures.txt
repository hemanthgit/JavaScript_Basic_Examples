What is a closure?
    A closure is an "inner function" that has access to the outer function’s variables in addition to it's own variables and global variables. 
    The inner function has access not only to the outer function’s variables, but also to the outer function’s parameters.
    You create a closure by adding a function inside another function.
    A closure is function inside a function. 
    These functions, that is the inner and outer functions could be named functions or anonymous functions.
