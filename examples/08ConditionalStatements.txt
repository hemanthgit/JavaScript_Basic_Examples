JavaScript code is executed in a linear fashion from the first line to the last line. 
If for some reason you want to interrupt this flow and execute certain statements only, if certain condition is met, then we use conditional statements.

JavaScript has the following conditional statements
 if 
 if else 
 if elseif else 
 switch ternary operator - shortcut for an if...else statement

Switch:
 When should we use switch statement?
 To improve the readability of a program multiple if else if statements can be replaced with a switch statement.
 In general we need to have break statement after each case statement to ensure the program breaks out of the switch statement after executing statements present in a specific case.
What happens if there is no break in a switch statement? 
 If there is no break statement the execution falls automatically to next case until a break statement is encountered or end of the program is reached. 

Ternary operator:
 It can be used as a shortcut for 'if...else...' statement.
