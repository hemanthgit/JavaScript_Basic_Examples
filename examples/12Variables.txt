In JavaScript there are two types of variables
 1. Local variables 
 2. Global variables

Local Variables:
---------------
   1.Local variables are the variables declared with in a function.
   2.These variables have local scope meaning these are available only inside the function that contains them.
   3.Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted as soon as the function completes execution.

Global Variables:
----------------
    1.Global variables are the variables declared outside a function.
    2.Global variables have global scope meaning all scripts and functions on the page can access them.
    3.The lifetime of a global variable starts with it's declaration and is deleted when the page is closed.

Note: 
    1.If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared,
    it will automatically becomes a global variable,even if it is present inside a function.
    2.A local variable can have the same name as a global variable. 
    Changing the value of one variable has no effect on the other. 
    If the variable value is changed inside a function, and if a local version of the variable exists then the local variable gets modified. 
    If the variable value is changed outside a function then the global variable gets modified.

Variable Hoisting:
-----------------
    Variable Hoisting is similar to function Hoisting.
    Sometimes, variable hoisting and local & global variable with the same name can cause unexpected behavior. 

Braces do not create scope in JavaScript.If you define a variable inside the braces like if block then it becomes global scope.
