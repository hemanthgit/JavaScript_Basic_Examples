Just like Java, JavaScript is also an object oriented programming language. 
However, JavaScript is not very strict in reporting or throwing errors.

For Ex, In Java, if you assign a value to a variable that is not declared, you get an error.
Where as the same code in JavaScript does not raise any error. JavaScript automatically creates a global variable with that name. 
This kind of a behaviour may lead the developer to make more mistakes. 

Just like Java, if you want JavaScript also to throw an error, then use Strict Mode.
How to enable strict mode in JavaScript ?
    Just add "use strict" statement in your script file.

if you specified "use strict" at the top of the JavaScript file, strictness will be enforced across the entire script file. 

How to enforce JavaScript strictness in a specific function?
 Just add "use strict" statement inside the function alone. 

In JavaScript, if you assign a value to a read-only property, JavaScript silently fails without raising an error. refer 37ReadOnlyWithoutStrictness.html
If you want JavaScript to raise an error instead of failing silently, use JavaScript strict mode. refer 37ReadOnlyWithStrictness.html

Note:
-----
    ECMAScript version 5 introduced strict mode to JavaScript.
    With strict mode ON it is easier to detect JavaScript silent errors as they would throw an error now. 
    This makes debugging much easier and the chances of developers making mistakes is reduced. 
    Most modern browsers support strict mode.
