<!-- Why did the JavaScript did not work in this case?
JavaScript code is present before the textbox control. By the time the JavaScript code is executed, the textbox is still
not loaded into browser DOM (Document Object Model). This is the reason JavaScript can't find the textbox and throws a NULL
reference error. -->
