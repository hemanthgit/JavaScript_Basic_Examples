Properties:
----------------
    Since JavaScript is also an object oriented programming language, objects in JavaScript can also have properties. 
Why do we need properties when we have public fields?
    Encapsulation is one of the pillars of object oriented programming language. 
    Properties provide encapsulation. 
    If you use public fields you cannot control on what is assigned and returned from that public field.
